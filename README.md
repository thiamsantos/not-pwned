> Check if your password has been pwned

It uses [have i been pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com) to verify if a password has appeared in a data breach. In order to protect the value of the source password being searched the value is not sended through the network. Instead it uses a [k-Anonymity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity) model that allows a [password to be searched for by partial hash](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2#SearchingPwnedPasswordsByRange). This allows the first 5 characters of a SHA-1 password hash to be passed to the API. Then this lib search the results of the response for the presence of their source hash and if not found, the password does not exist in the data set.
